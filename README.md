How to build a TWITTER Clone app 2021

I'll show you how you can do this in the simplest way and terms possible.

By the end of this series you'll have learned how the big companies do it and will be able to do the same, you not only will be able to do this app, but you'll be able to put what you learn into your very own projects!

In this series, we use Flutter to quickly deploy the project. We use firebase for all our microservice needs like the auth system, database, storage, amongst others.
